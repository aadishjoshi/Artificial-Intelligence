### Part 1
1) Lisp function fibonacci1 to compute fibonacci number of n

2) Lisp function fibonacci number of n (where n is a positive integer) recursively with a global variable (e.g., a list, an array, or a hash table) to save the previous results to be used later to compute the next fibonacci number

3) Lisp function fibonacci3 to compute fibonacci of n (where n is a positive integer) with a loop (iteratively) with a global variable (e.g., a list, an array, or a hash table, etc.) to save the previous results to be used later

4) FLATTEN, a function that returns all the elements of an arbitrarily nested list in a single-level list.

5) Lisp function EXP-EVAL, a function which evaluates an arithmetic expression. The binary operators used for an arithmetic expression are: +, -, *, and /

6) Lisp function PREFIX-EXP, a function which evaluates an arithmetic expression (infix notation) to the expression in prefix notation. The binary operators used for an arithmetic expression are: +, -, *, and /. For example, (PREFIX-EXP '(2 + (3 * 5))) should return its prefix notation of (+  2  *  3  5)
